# FCCM2021-GVPF-t
## Overview
This is the video processing demo we provide for FCCM2021. also for video face-resolution.   
Also, this is my master's project: RESEARCH ON FACE SUPER-RESOLUTION ALGORITHM BASED ON VIDEO STREAM.
## Result
I test four video streams using face super-resolution algorithm, as you can see in the demos, the face in low-resolution videos are emphysised.

## Introduction
This project contains three sub-project, as shown in my master's thesis: RESEARCH ON FACE SUPER-RESOLUTION ALGORITHM BASED ON VIDEO STREAM.  
The first part is model-1, aiming to produce a general super-resolution architecture based on single image.  
The second part is model-2, aiming to produce video SR algorithm based on face-loss trainging.
The last part is the implementation based on FPGA, due to the large size of the project, I provide this downlink : https://pan.baidu.com/s/1XiYbwig3OSuZ1EBXESMSZg the extract code: feng
## Experiment
### For model-1 and model-2
I use Pytorch for these two projects. You should have:  
pytorch >= 1.2.0  tensorboard  opencv  dlib  tqdm in your environment.
and the mise pre-model can be downloaded in: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ZjF8D0zkMVrGjuNDdu77rg extractor code: feng
### For FPGA
I do the experiment on Vivado 2019.2 and HLS 2019.2. So you'd better have a proper software version.
